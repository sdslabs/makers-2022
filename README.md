# Makers 2022
Makers tasks by SDSLabs.

Makers is an annual, one of a kind competition which lets you show off your awesome projects and ideas you make during the period of 15 days. You are allowed to work on your own ideas, but if you are out of one, we have curated a list of awesome ideas you can choose one from.

## Rules
There are no ground rules but one - *no plagarism*. We will invalidate the submission if we find such case. After all, this competition is for learning. Deadline for submissions: __24 March 2022 2359 Hours__.  

Double check if you are in the [SDSLabs open source discord server](https://discord.gg/3j4SfxjCmB) to interact with us. Keep an eye out on the discord server for important announcements. We'll also be organising Mentorship Weekends at the server during which SDSLabs members will be available throughout the weekend to assist you with your projects.

## Perks
The projects made by freshers which catch our eye will earn their makers a direct interview for SDSLabs recruitment.

## Eligibility
Any student of IIT Roorkee is eligible to make a submission and interact with us regarding their project. However, only freshers are eligible for the direct interview. Also, Makers is an individual participation event. 

## Ideas
Find the ideas list for this edition of Makers [here](ideas.pdf). There is no compulsion to work on an idea from this list, you're free to do anything as long as it involves making something with code.

## Submission
For a valid submission, you would be needing a source code repository link, a demo page (if it's a web app) or an executable (for native app). More instructions for submission will be announced soon.

Happy hacking!
